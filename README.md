# ðŸ•Œ Darija Travel Chatbot (Rasa)

## ðŸ‘¥ Authors

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Context

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment in the  
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** module;
supervised by **Prof. [J. Zahir]**,  
of the **Artificial Intelligence Master's Program**.


This is a simple travel agency assistant built with **Rasa**, speaking in **Darija (Moroccan Arabic)**. It helps users with tasks like **booking flights** or **reserving hotels** using natural conversations.

## ðŸ§  Current Focus

We are currently focusing on building the **core logic** of the chatbot:

- Catching key information from the user (dates, destinations, flight class, etc.)
- Handling **missing slot values** with follow-up questions
- Supporting **basic conversation flows** in **Darija**

## ðŸš€ Future Plans

Next steps will include:

- More advanced logic for flight and hotel booking
- Integration with real APIs for flights/hotels
- Enhancing conversation with richer responses and fallback handling
